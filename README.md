# Flappy Submarine
Flappy submarine is a simple game that serves as a testing ground for the capabilities of the three.js library. 
I was a university project developed with WebGL for the Image Synthesis subject. 

It is a videogame based on the famous game named Flappy Bird. 
This time, it was ambiented in an under the sea biome, where you are a submarine that has to evade sea mines.

## How to play?
To play this game is very simple. 

> The game was tested on a windows computer using google chrome, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. If you use another engine or resolution it might not work as expected.

First you select the visual settings you wish to play on, click play and click the screen to jump. 
Avoid as many sea mines as you can and stay alive to get points. Try to beat your own record or play against your friends!

### WARNING
There's a very weird bug that every time you change the visualisation mode, the fps increase. 
This results are, when going into the third or fourth change, you go 200+ fps, while your computer is using +80% of your GPU, resulting in potential slowness of your computer.
> I am not responsible of problems derived of the bad use of this web game.

### WHAT TO DO
Every time you want to change the visualisation mode, it is recommended to first recharge the web page (or f5). This way the fps are reseted and your computer
won't be hurt.
